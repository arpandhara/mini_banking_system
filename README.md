🏦 Mini Banking System (Backend)

A robust, secure, and scalable backend API for personal banking operations.

This project serves as the core infrastructure for a personal banking application. Built with Python (Flask) and MongoDB, it facilitates secure user authentication, real-time transaction processing, financial goal tracking, and contact management. It features SMS notification integration via Twilio and ensures data security through hashed credentials and environment-based configuration.

🌟 Key Features

🔐 Secure Authentication: User registration, login, and password management using Werkzeug security hashing.

💸 Transaction Management: Real-time processing of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.

📈 Dashboard Analytics: Aggregated views of balances, income vs. expenses, and transaction history.

🎯 Savings Goals: Create, track, and liquidate custom savings goals.

👥 Contact Management: Manage a list of payees (contacts) for quick transfers.

📱 SMS Notifications: Integrated Twilio support for OTPs and temporary passwords.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6+ installed.

A MongoDB Atlas account (Free Tier M0 is sufficient).

(Optional) A Twilio account for SMS features.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/arpandhara/mini_banking_system.git](https://github.com/arpandhara/mini_banking_system.git)
cd mini_banking_system


2. Initialize Virtual Environment

Isolate your dependencies by creating a virtual environment.

Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirement.txt


⚙️ Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

This application requires a cloud database connection. Follow these steps to configure MongoDB Atlas:

Create a Cluster: Log in to MongoDB Atlas, create a project, and deploy a database (Select M0 Sandbox for free tier).

Create Database User:

Navigate to Database Access.

Click Add New Database User.

Set a Username (e.g., admin) and a Strong Password.

Set Privileges to "Read and write to any database".

Whitelist IP Address:

Navigate to Network Access.

Click Add IP Address -> Add Current IP Address.

Get Connection String:

Go to Database -> Connect -> Drivers.

Select Python (Version 3.6+).

Copy the connection string provided.

🔑 Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory to store sensitive credentials. You can use the template below:

# --- MongoDB Connection ---
# Replace <username> and <password> with your Atlas credentials.
# NOTE: Ensure '/MiniBankingSystem' is specified before the '?' to auto-create the DB.
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/MiniBankingSystem?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# --- Twilio Configuration (Optional) ---
# Leave these blank if SMS functionality is not required.
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here


🏃‍♂️ Running the Application
